# Geometry Deck
**Geometry Dash but overhauled to look like Steam's Big Picture Mode / Steam Deck!**

Thank you to **at4pm** for the mod idea, <cb>cdc</c> for **Level Thumbnails**, and <cy>Beat</c> for testing the mod!

This mod comes with **controller** support built in as well! It's encouraged to use it, or your **Steam Deck** to have a Steam Deck-like experience!

Leave any suggestions on my **Discord Server!**, more features will be added as I get more time to work on this mod!

# PLEASE read below before using the mod, otherwise you will be confused on where to go!

# Keybinds
In case you don't have a controller and are on PC (or want to reconfigure your controller bindings), here are the keybinds:
- `Enter` = A 
- `Escape` = B or Back
- `Backspace` = Pause
- `Left Arrow` = DPad Left
- `Right Arrow` = DPad Right
- `Up Arrow` = DPad Up
- `Down Arrow` = DPad Down
*no you currently cannot customize them, maybe in a future update*

## Main Menu
- All your recently saved levels, and the ability to filter based on folders.

## Top Bar
- **Icon** (clickable).
- The **current time** based on your locale.
- **Battery Status** (Clickable) [Only works on Laptop or Steam Deck].
- **Chest** (clickable)

## Side Bar 
- **Home**
    - Icon Kit Menu (GarageLayer) to choose your icons
    - Main Levels to play any main levels
    - Online, or Creator Menu 
    - `Please note that this will be changed in a future update for better UX`
- **Geode**
    - Geode, duh!
- **Stats**
- **Settings**
- **Achievements**
- **Exit**
    - Restart Game to restart Geometry Dash
    - Exit Game to exit Geometry Dash

## Bottom Bar 
- This part also acts as a "controller simulation" if you click on the buttons, but it is mainly for helping those on controller to know what buttons do what.
- In case you are confused what **Start** is, it is next to the pause button

# Note 
- Some mods that add their own buttons in the main menu **might now** show up in the sidebar. In future updates, this will be fixed to add support to the buttons.
- If for whatever reason on the **Steam Deck** your current layout doesn't work well, it's best to reconfigure your controls to match a controller, or to match the ones listed in the **Keybinds** section.
- Also, controllers on **Android** may not work, so please do not complain if you have issues.

~~(also valve please do not attack me im a fan of your ui)~~
